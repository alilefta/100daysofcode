## Day 1:
### Java
Java fundamentals which includes operators, methods and passing data:

**Types of Operators**

 - Arithmetic Operators
 - Comparison Operators
 - Logical Operators
 - Bitwise Operators
 - Assignment Operators
 - Bit shift Operators
 - Instanceof Operator

**Rules to follow when dealing with arithmetic operations in Java:**

 - Multiplicative operators (*, %, /) have a precedence over additive and subtractive operators (+, - ) when there are a different operators in the same operation. i.e. `int x = (5 * 3 + 2 / 20 - 5);`. 
 - Operators in the same group are evaluated from left to right.
 - We can use parenthesis to change evaluation order. i.e. `int z = (((5 / 2) * 3) + (5 / 20))`.
 

 - . Operand promotion: Operands smaller than **int** are promoted to **int**.               i.e. 125 (byte) + 2 (byte) --> 125 (int) + 2 (int) --> 127 (int).
